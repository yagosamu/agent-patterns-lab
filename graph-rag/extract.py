    Read the text below and extract:
    1. ENTITIES — named things (people, organizations, products, concepts, places, events)
    2. RELATIONSHIPS — how those entities connect to each other 
    
    Return ONLY valid JSON. No explanation, no markdown, no codefences.
    Format:
    {
        "entities": [
            {"id": "e1", "name": "Entity Name", "type": "Person|Organization|Product|Concept|Place|Event"}

        "relationships": [
            {"source": "e1", "target": "e2", "relation": "RELATION_TYPE"}
        ]
    }
    Rules:
        - Use short, uppercase relation types like WORKS_AT, CREATED, ACQUIRED, USES, LOCATED_IN
        - Every relationship must reference entity ids that exist in the entities list
        - Extract only what is explicitly stated in the text
        - Deduplicate: if the same entity appears multiple times, usethe same id
